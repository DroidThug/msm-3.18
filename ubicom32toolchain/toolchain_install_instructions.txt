#----Please check these first----
#The GNU build environment is broken on a default install of Ubuntu.   In order to build Ubicom tools on Ubuntu, the following packages must be installed:   #libc6-dev, texinfo, bison, flex, tk, g++, libncurses-dev, libx11-dev, and expect also build-essential.  To fetch and install a package, execute:

#sudo apt-get install package

#Do all these as root.For switch to root use "sudo su" for ubuntu/
#1-)Installing gmp and mpfr
#Go into the toolchain source directory which should include binutils , gcc ,gmp ,mpfr directories. 
#Get into gmp directory and type 
./configure --prefix=/usr/local 
#and then type 
make 
#after that type 
make install

#Get into mpfr directory and type 
./configure --prefix=/usr/local 
#and then type 
make 
#after that type 
make install

#2-)You need a place where toolchain will install.
#Say it opt/ubicom32tools (you can change this path to wyw)
cd /
cd opt
mkdir ubicom32tools
cd ubicom32tools
mkdir bin  #we do this and will add to PATH because gcc will check binutils for cross platform from here
export PATH=/opt/ubicom32tools/bin:$PATH

#Go into the toolchain source directory which should include binutils , gcc ,gmp ,mpfr directories. 
#We need two obj directory for toolchain and binutils.
mkdir obj-toolchain
mkdir obj-gcc
cd obj-toolchain #we will configure toolchain here this means all messy stuff will here and our source will clean.
#run (you can change --prefix path to wyw)
../binutils/configure --target=ubicom32-elf --enable-gdbmi --enable-install-libbfd --prefix=/opt/ubicom32tools --enable-languages=c --enable-libssp=no --enable-libada=no --enable-newlib=no --enable-libgloss=no --enable-rda=no --disable-werror
#before make chamge some permissions in binutils directory
chmod 777 utils/spu/configure
chmod 777 gdb/observer.sh
#if you do something wrong use "rm -rf *' command this will clean directory so toolchain build
#if everything is ok run
make
#and then 
make install
# now you can check /opt/ubicom32tools/bin for ubicom32-elf-as or ubicom32-elf-ld and etc. 
# Simply type "ubicom32-elf-ld -v" it will work because it is in our PATH . Version should 2.19 for binutils.

#Now we will compile gcc so
# goto obj-gcc
cd ..
cd obj-gcc
#export libraries path
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib
# and then type ( in here  "--with-gmp=/usr/local --with-mpfr=/usr/local" /usr/local shows where is your gmp and mpfr install
# --prefix=/opt/ubicom32tools shows where is ypur binutils binaries.
../gcc/configure --with-gmp=/usr/local --with-mpfr=/usr/local --target=ubicom32-elf --enable-gdbmi --enable-install-libbfd --prefix=/opt/ubicom32tools --enable-languages=c --enable-libssp=no --enable-libada=no
#if all good
make
#and then 
make install
#please check gcc by simply typing 
ubicom32-elf-gcc -v
#version should 4.3.2
#TBD: Do all these as script.
