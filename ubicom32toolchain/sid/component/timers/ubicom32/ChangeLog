2001-09-10  Jeff Johnston  <jjohnstn@redhat.com>

	* ip4k.cxx (ip4kTimerGeneric::stream_state): Add blanks in front of 
	strings to allow parsing and use '-' instead of blank in names
	of stored values.
	(ip4kTimerGeneric::destream_state): Use '-' instead of blanks
	in names to parse for.

2001-07-11  Frank Ch. Eigler  <fche@redhat.com>

	* hw-timer-ip4k_ref.xml: Add <?xml ... ?> prefix.

2001-07-06  Frank Ch. Eigler  <fche@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): Define.
	* aclocal.m4, autoconf, Makefile.in: Regenerated.

	* configure.in: Add maintainer-mode doc building configury.
	* configure: Regenerate.
	* Makefile.am: Add maintainer-mode doc building.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerate.

2001-07-04  Ben Elliston  <bje@redhat.com>

	* hw-timer-ip4k_ref.xml: Use &lt where necessary.
	* hw-timer-ip4k_ref.txt: Generate.

2001-06-28  Ben Elliston  <bje@redhat.com>

	* hw-timer-ip4k_ref.xml: New file.

2001-03-23  Dave Brolley  <brolley@redhat.com>

	* ip4k.cxx (word_write): Allow writes to addresses 6 and 7.
	(word_read): Allow reads at addresses 6 and 7.

2000-11-15  Jeff Johnston  <jjohnstn@redhat.com>

        * configure: Regenerated.
        * aclocal.m4: Ditto.
        * Makefile.in: Ditto.

2000-10-20  Jeff Johnston <jjohnstn@redhat.com>

	* ip4k.cxx (timer_enable_pin_handler):  Changed code to not
	perform full reset on enablement.  Code now performs a counter
	reset only.  Also added code to set curcmp1 and curcmp2
	on enablement as this counts as a new pwm cycle.
	(set_tmren): Ditto.
	(word_read): Added proper parentheses to handle C precedence rules.
	* ip4k-timer.h (TXCFG1_OFIE_SHIFT): Corrected.

2000-10-18  Jeff Johnston <jjohnstn@redhat.com>

	* ip4k.cxx (ip4kTimerGeneric): Added "tick-count" setting
	attribute.
	(tick): Changed code to loop for tick_count times through
	main loop to handle case where multiple insns are performed
	uninterrupted.
	* ip4k-timer.h (tick_count): New member.
	* hw-timer-ip4k_ref.txt: Updated documentation to include
	information on "tick-count" which is tied directly to the
	"insn-count" simulator option.  Also corrected minor typos.

2000-10-18  Jeff Johnston <jjohnstn@redhat.com>

	* ip4k.cxx (ip4kTimerGeneric): Removed redundant attribute
	setting for "mode" and "prescale-log2".  Also added watchable
	pin: "timer-enable".
	* hw-timer-ip4k_ref.txt: Updated documentation on connecting
	CPU to timer so that sched 0-event is connected to timer clocks.

2000-10-13  Jeff Johnston <jjohnstn@redhat.com>

	* hw-timer-ip4k_ref.txt: Updated to match V1.11 timer spec.
	* ip4k.cxx: General rewrite to match V1.11 timer spec which
	differs from timer chapter in overall spec.  Registers have
	changed as well as storage layout.  For pwm-mode, changes
	in txcmp1 or txcmp2 are delayed until the next cycle starts.
	There are added interrupt enable bits and the addition of
	event flags in txcfg1.  The txcfg2 register holds the prescale
	log2 value, cpi1edg, cpi2edg, and cpi2cpi1 whereas it was not
	used before.  The tctrl register of the cpu is now specified.
	(txrst): New pin to connect to tctrl register txrst bit in cpu.
	(txie): New pin to connect to tctrl register txie bit in cpu.
	(ip4kTimerGeneric): Set watchable attributes for all major
	state members.
	(destream, stream): Added all major variables.
	(txcpi1_pin_handler): Added edge checking based on cpi1edg setting.
	(txcpi2_pin_handler): Added edge checking based on cpi2edg setting.
	* ip4k-timer.h (cap1rst, cmp1ie, cap1ie, ofie): New variables
	added as part of rewrite.
	(cap1if, cmp1if, cap2if, ofif, cpi1edg, cpi2edg, cpi2cpi1): Ditto.
	(txie_pin, txrst_pin): New pins.

2000-09-08  Jeff Johnston <jjohnstn@redhat.com>

	* hw-timer-ip4k_ref.txt: Updated to properly discuss
	enablement pin issues.
	* ip4k-timer.h (enabled, timer_enable): New booleans.
	(timer_enable_pin_handler): New method to handle timer enable
	changes in global control register.
	* ip4k.cxx (ip4kGenericTimer): Initialized new booleans.
	Also changed "enabled" attribute to point to enabled instead of
	tmren.
	(tick, tmrxcpi1_pin_handle, tmrxcpi2_pin_handle): Changed to
	use "enabled" instead of "tmren".
	(timer_enable_pin_handler): New pin handler to sense when the
	global control register timer enable bit changes value.
	(bus_interface::word_w): Added code to properly set "enabled"
	and possibly reset the timer if new setting of TMREN causes the
	timer to become enabled.
	(stream, destream): Added streaming/destreaming enabled and 
	timer_enable.
