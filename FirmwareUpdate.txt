Firmware Update Function
========================

The driver uses the kernel's request_firmware() feature to obtain the firmware
image for the touch sensor.  The firmware image is expected to live in
the file firmware/synaptics/<firmware_name>.img.ihex.

Use the command below to convert the .img firmware image provided by Synaptics
to the .ihex format.

   objcopy -I binary -O ihex <firmware_name>.img firmware/<firmware_name>.img.ihex

To inlcude the firmware image in the kernel build so that it can be used for
doing firmware update during device initialization, make sure the line below is
included in the file firmware/Makefile.

   fw-shipped-$(CONFIG_TOUCHSCREEN_SYNAPTICS_DSX_FW_UPDATE) += synaptics/<firmware_name>.img

The function synaptics_fw_updater() defined in synaptics_dsx_fw_update.c is
called to initiate the firmware update process.
