Summary:
================
This directory contains the source code for USB Synpopsys driver of U-Boot. The development of this driver is 
closely related to Synopsys HS OTG USB2.0 of Linux: core parts of the source code originate from the Linux 
Synpopsys driver.

Support:
================
This driver supports all U-Boot USB commands to start, reset, stop, read, and write storage device.

Software Configuration:
=======================
a) Enable/Disable the first USB port:
	CONFIG_DWC_PORT0_ENABLE

c) Enable/Disable the second USB port:
	CONFIG_DWC_PORT1_ENABLE

d) Enable OTG mode for first USB port:
	CONFIG_DWC_PORT0_OTG

e) Enable source code of OTG mode in driver:
	CONFIG_DWC_MODE_OTG

U-Boot Driver Support
=======================
This section describes the difference among U-Boot Synpopsys driver.

a) Support U-Boot USB Methods:
	submit_control_msg 
	submit_int_msg  
	submit_bulk_msg

	usb_lowlevel_init
	usb_lowlevel_stop

	These methods are in driver/dwc_otg_hcd_uboot.c.

b) Poll Interrupt Status Register 
	Poll interrupt status register to handle transfer completion after submission of USB URB.

	This is implemented in driver/dwc_otg_hcd_uboot.c.

c) Delete descriptor DMA related code
	These code is not used in U-Boot.

d) Modify Linux kernel related code 
	Modify the code related to Linux kernel to adapt to U-Boot, including tasklet, spinlock, kmalloc, and so on.

	The most of source code in dwc_common_port is modified to adapt to U-Boot. 

e) Add unsched queue for QH
	This queue is to keep all the endpoints that are currently served. This is to keep the right toggle for transfer 
	to each endpoint.

f) Modify hub_control 
	The root hub descriptors are defined in new file dwc_otg_hcd_hub.h. The root hub related methods for these new descriptors are 
	also added in hub_control.

	The number that represent each hub request is also different in U-Boot. They are modified to adapt to U-Boot. 	
	   
9) Delete all stop watch code
	This is not used in U-Boot.

k) Delete all PCI related code
	This is not used in driver.

l) Fix bugs related to hcd stop
