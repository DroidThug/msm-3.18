# Texas Instruments TWL series PWM drivers connected to LED terminals
#
# Supported PWMs:
# On TWL4030 series: PWMA and PWMB (connected to LEDA and LEDB terminals)
# On TWL6030 series: LED PWM (mainly used as charging indicator LED)
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: "ti,twl4030-pwmled" or "ti,twl6030-pwmled"
# - #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
#   the cells format.
#
# Example:
#
# twl_pwmled: pwmled {
# 	compatible = "ti,twl6030-pwmled";
# 	#pwm-cells = <2>;
# };
