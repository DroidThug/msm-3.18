# Rockchip PWM controller
#
# Required properties:
#  - compatible: should be "rockchip,<name>-pwm"
#    "rockchip,rk2928-pwm": found on RK29XX,RK3066 and RK3188 SoCs
#    "rockchip,rk3288-pwm": found on RK3288 SoC
#    "rockchip,vop-pwm": found integrated in VOP on RK3288 SoC
#  - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
#  - clocks: phandle and clock specifier of the PWM reference clock
#  - #pwm-cells: must be 2 (rk2928) or 3 (rk3288). See pwm.txt in this directory
#    for a description of the cell format.
#
# Example:
#
# 	pwm0: pwm@20030000 {
# 		compatible = "rockchip,rk2928-pwm";
# 		reg = <0x20030000 0x10>;
# 		clocks = <&cru PCLK_PWM01>;
# 		#pwm-cells = <2>;
