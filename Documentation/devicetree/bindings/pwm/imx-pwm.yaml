# Freescale i.MX PWM controller
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible : should be "fsl,<soc>-pwm" and one of the following
#    compatible strings:
#   - "fsl,imx1-pwm" for PWM compatible with the one integrated on i.MX1
#   - "fsl,imx27-pwm" for PWM compatible with the one integrated on i.MX27
# - reg: physical base address and length of the controller's registers
# - #pwm-cells: should be 2. See pwm.txt in this directory for a description of
#   the cells format.
# - clocks : Clock specifiers for both ipg and per clocks.
# - clock-names : Clock names should include both "ipg" and "per"
# See the clock consumer binding,
# 	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt
# - interrupts: The interrupt for the pwm controller
#
# Example:
#
# pwm1: pwm@53fb4000 {
# 	#pwm-cells = <2>;
# 	compatible = "fsl,imx53-pwm", "fsl,imx27-pwm";
# 	reg = <0x53fb4000 0x4000>;
# 	clocks = <&clks IMX5_CLK_PWM1_IPG_GATE>,
# 		 <&clks IMX5_CLK_PWM1_HF_GATE>;
# 	clock-names = "ipg", "per";
# 	interrupts = <61>;
# };
