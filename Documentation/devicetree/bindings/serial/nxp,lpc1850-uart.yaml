# * NXP LPC1850 UART
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible	: "nxp,lpc1850-uart", "ns16550a".
# - reg		: offset and length of the register set for the device.
# - interrupts	: should contain uart interrupt.
# - clocks	: phandle to the input clocks.
# - clock-names	: required elements: "uartclk", "reg".
#
# Optional properties:
# - dmas		: Two or more DMA channel specifiers following the
# 		  convention outlined in bindings/dma/dma.txt
# - dma-names	: Names for the dma channels, if present. There must
# 		  be at least one channel named "tx" for transmit
# 		  and named "rx" for receive.
#
# Since it's also possible to also use the of_serial.c driver all
# parameters from 8250.txt also apply but are optional.
#
# Example:
# uart0: serial@40081000 {
# 	compatible = "nxp,lpc1850-uart", "ns16550a";
# 	reg = <0x40081000 0x1000>;
# 	reg-shift = <2>;
# 	interrupts = <24>;
# 	clocks = <&ccu2 CLK_APB0_UART0>, <&ccu1 CLK_CPU_UART0>;
# 	clock-names = "uartclk", "reg";
# };
