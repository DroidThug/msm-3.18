# Binding for Conexant Digicolor USART
#
# Note: this binding is only applicable for using the USART peripheral as
# UART. USART also support synchronous serial protocols like SPI and I2S. Use
# the binding that matches the wiring of your system.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible : should be "cnxt,cx92755-usart".
# - reg: Should contain USART controller registers location and length.
# - interrupts: Should contain a single USART controller interrupt.
# - clocks: Must contain phandles to the USART clock
#   See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
#
# Note: Each UART port should have an alias correctly numbered
# in "aliases" node.
#
# Example:
# 	aliases {
# 		serial0 = &uart0;
# 	};
#
# 	uart0: uart@f0000740 {
# 		compatible = "cnxt,cx92755-usart";
# 		reg = <0xf0000740 0x20>;
# 		clocks = <&main_clk>;
# 		interrupts = <44>;
# 	};
