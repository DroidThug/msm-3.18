# NVIDIA Legacy Interrupt Controller
#
# All Tegra SoCs contain a legacy interrupt controller that routes
# interrupts to the GIC, and also serves as a wakeup source. It is also
# referred to as "ictlr", hence the name of the binding.
#
# The HW block exposes a number of interrupt controllers, each
# implementing a set of 32 interrupts.
#
# Required properties:
#
# - compatible : should be: "nvidia,tegra<chip>-ictlr". The LIC on
#   subsequent SoCs remained backwards-compatible with Tegra30, so on
#   Tegra generations later than Tegra30 the compatible value should
#   include "nvidia,tegra30-ictlr".
# - reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
#   Each controller must be described separately (Tegra20 has 4 of them,
#   whereas Tegra30 and later have 5"
# - interrupt-controller : Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
# - #interrupt-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
#   interrupt source. The value must be 3.
# - interrupt-parent : a phandle to the GIC these interrupts are routed
#   to.
#
# Notes:
#
# - Because this HW ultimately routes interrupts to the GIC, the
#   interrupt specifier must be that of the GIC.
# - Only SPIs can use the ictlr as an interrupt parent. SGIs and PPIs
#   are explicitly forbidden.
#
# Example:
#
# 	ictlr: interrupt-controller@60004000 {
# 		compatible = "nvidia,tegra20-ictlr", "nvidia,tegra-ictlr";
# 		reg = <0x60004000 64>,
# 		      <0x60004100 64>,
# 		      <0x60004200 64>,
# 		      <0x60004300 64>;
# 		interrupt-controller;
# 		#interrupt-cells = <3>;
# 		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
# 	};
