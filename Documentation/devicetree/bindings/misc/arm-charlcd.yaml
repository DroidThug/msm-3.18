# -----------------------------------------------------
# This binding defines the character LCD interface found on ARM Versatile AB
# and PB reference platforms.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible : "arm,versatile-clcd"
# - reg : Location and size of character LCD registers
#
# Optional properties:
# - interrupts - single interrupt for character LCD. The character LCD can
#   operate in polled mode without an interrupt.

# 		compatible = "arm,versatile-lcd";
# 		reg = <0x10008000 0x1000>;
# 	};
