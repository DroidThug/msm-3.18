QTI APQ8084 Docking Station

This device describes the interface used when connecting to the
Docking Station's USB hub and Ethernet ports. The interface
consists of GPIOs used for controlling the main power supply
and reset lines.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "qti,apq8084-dock"
 - qti,dock-detect-gpio: phandle to a GPIO node corresponding to the input
                         signal indicating when the dock is connected
 - qti,dock-enable-gpio: phandle to a GPIO node corresponding to the output
                         signal that turns on/off power to the ports
 - qti,dock-hub-reset-gpio: phandle to a GPIO node corresponding to the output
                            signal that resets the USB ports
 - qti,dock-eth-reset-gpio: phandle to a GPIO node corresponding to the output
                            signal that resets the Ethernet ports
