# I2C for OMAP platforms
#
# Required properties :
# - compatible : Must be "ti,omap2420-i2c", "ti,omap2430-i2c", "ti,omap3-i2c"
#   or "ti,omap4-i2c"
# - ti,hwmods : Must be "i2c<n>", n being the instance number (1-based)
# - #address-cells = <1>;
# - #size-cells = <0>;
#
# Recommended properties :
# - clock-frequency : Desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz. Otherwise
#   the default 100 kHz frequency will be used.
#
# Optional properties:
# - Child nodes conforming to i2c bus binding
#
# Note: Current implementation will fetch base address, irq and dma
# from omap hwmod data base during device registration.
# Future plan is to migrate hwmod data base contents into device tree
# blob so that, all the required data will be used from device tree dts
# file.
#
# Examples :
#
# i2c1: i2c@0 {
#     compatible = "ti,omap3-i2c";
#     #address-cells = <1>;
#     #size-cells = <0>;
#     ti,hwmods = "i2c1";
#     clock-frequency = <400000>;
# };
