# Broadcom Kona Family I2C
# =========================
#
# This I2C controller is used in the following Broadcom SoCs:
#
#   BCM11130
#   BCM11140
#   BCM11351
#   BCM28145
#   BCM28155
#
# Required Properties
# -------------------
# - compatible: "brcm,bcm11351-i2c", "brcm,kona-i2c"
# - reg: Physical base address and length of controller registers
# - interrupts: The interrupt number used by the controller
# - clocks: clock specifier for the kona i2c external clock
# - clock-frequency: The I2C bus frequency in Hz
# - #address-cells: Should be <1>
# - #size-cells: Should be <0>
#
# Refer to clocks/clock-bindings.txt for generic clock consumer
# properties.
#
# Example:
#
# i2c@3e016000 {
# 	compatible = "brcm,bcm11351-i2c","brcm,kona-i2c";
# 	reg = <0x3e016000 0x80>;
# 	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 103 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
# 	clocks = <&bsc1_clk>;
# 	clock-frequency = <400000>;
# 	#address-cells = <1>;
# 	#size-cells = <0>;
# };
