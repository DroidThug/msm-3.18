# * Texas Instruments Davinci I2C
#
# This file provides information, what the device node for the
# davinci i2c interface contain.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: "ti,davinci-i2c";
# - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
#
# Recommended properties :
# - interrupts : standard interrupt property.
# - clock-frequency : desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.
# - ti,has-pfunc: boolean; if defined, it indicates that SoC supports PFUNC
# 	registers. PFUNC registers allow to switch I2C pins to function as
# 	GPIOs, so they can by toggled manually.
#
# Example (enbw_cmc board):
# 	i2c@1c22000 {
# 		compatible = "ti,davinci-i2c";
# 		reg = <0x22000 0x1000>;
# 		clock-frequency = <100000>;
# 		interrupts = <15>;
# 		interrupt-parent = <&intc>;
# 		#address-cells = <1>;
# 		#size-cells = <0>;
#
# 		dtt@48 {
# 			compatible = "national,lm75";
# 			reg = <0x48>;
# 		};
# 	};
