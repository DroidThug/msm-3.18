# Conexant Digicolor I2C controller
#
# Required properties:
#  - compatible: must be "cnxt,cx92755-i2c"
#  - reg: physical address and length of the device registers
#  - interrupts: a single interrupt specifier
#  - clocks: clock for the device
#  - #address-cells: should be <1>
#  - #size-cells: should be <0>
#
# Optional properties:
# - clock-frequency: the desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz; in
#   absence of this property the default value is used (100 kHz).
#
# Example:
#
# 	i2c: i2c@f0000120 {
# 		compatible = "cnxt,cx92755-i2c";
# 		reg = <0xf0000120 0x10>;
# 		interrupts = <28>;
# 		clocks = <&main_clk>;
# 		clock-frequency = <100000>;
# 		#address-cells = <1>;
# 		#size-cells = <0>;
# 	};
