# I2C for Hisilicon hix5hd2 chipset platform
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: Must be "hisilicon,hix5hd2-i2c"
# - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
#      region.
# - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
# - #address-cells = <1>;
# - #size-cells = <0>;
# - clocks: phandles to input clocks.
#
# Optional properties:
# - clock-frequency: Desired I2C bus frequency in Hz, otherwise defaults to 100000
# - Child nodes conforming to i2c bus binding
#
# Examples:
# I2C0@f8b10000 {
# 	compatible = "hisilicon,hix5hd2-i2c";
# 	reg = <0xf8b10000 0x1000>;
# 	interrupts = <0 38 4>;
# 	clocks = <&clock HIX5HD2_I2C0_RST>;
# 	#address-cells = <1>;
# 	#size-cells = <0>;
# }
