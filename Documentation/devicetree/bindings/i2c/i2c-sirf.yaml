# I2C for SiRFprimaII platforms
#
# Required properties :
# - compatible : Must be "sirf,prima2-i2c"
# - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
#      region.
# - interrupts: interrupt number to the cpu.
#
# Optional properties:
# - clock-frequency : Constains desired I2C/HS-I2C bus clock frequency in Hz.
#   The absence of the propoerty indicates the default frequency 100 kHz.
#
# Examples :
#
# i2c0: i2c@b00e0000 {
#     compatible = "sirf,prima2-i2c";
#     reg = <0xb00e0000 0x10000>;
#     interrupts = <24>;
# };
