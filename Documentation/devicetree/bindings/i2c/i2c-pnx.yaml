# * NXP PNX I2C Controller
#
# Required properties:
#
#  - reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device
#  - compatible: should be "nxp,pnx-i2c"
#  - interrupts: configure one interrupt line
#  - #address-cells: always 1 (for i2c addresses)
#  - #size-cells: always 0
#  - interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller that
#    services interrupts for this device.
#
# Optional properties:
#
#  - clock-frequency: desired I2C bus clock frequency in Hz, Default: 100000 Hz
#
# Examples:
#
# 	i2c1: i2c@400a0000 {
# 		compatible = "nxp,pnx-i2c";
# 		reg = <0x400a0000 0x100>;
# 		interrupt-parent = <&mic>;
# 		interrupts = <51 0>;
# 		#address-cells = <1>;
# 		#size-cells = <0>;
# 	};
#
# 	i2c2: i2c@400a8000 {
# 		compatible = "nxp,pnx-i2c";
# 		reg = <0x400a8000 0x100>;
# 		interrupt-parent = <&mic>;
# 		interrupts = <50 0>;
# 		#address-cells = <1>;
# 		#size-cells = <0>;
# 		clock-frequency = <100000>;
# 	};
