# * TWL4030's Keypad Controller device tree bindings
#
# TWL4030's Keypad controller is used to interface a SoC with a matrix-type
# keypad device. The keypad controller supports multiple row and column lines.
# A key can be placed at each intersection of a unique row and a unique column.
# The keypad controller can sense a key-press and key-release and report the
# event using a interrupt to the cpu.
#
# This binding is based on the matrix-keymap binding with the following
# changes:
#
#  * keypad,num-rows and keypad,num-columns are required.
#
# Required SoC Specific Properties:
# - compatible: should be one of the following
#    - "ti,twl4030-keypad": For controllers compatible with twl4030 keypad
#       controller.
# - interrupt: should be one of the following
#    - <1>: For controllers compatible with twl4030 keypad controller.
#
# Example:
# 	twl_keypad: keypad {
# 		compatible = "ti,twl4030-keypad";
# 		interrupts = <1>;
# 		keypad,num-rows = <8>;
# 		keypad,num-columns = <8>;
# 	};
