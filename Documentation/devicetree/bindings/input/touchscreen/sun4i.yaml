# sun4i resistive touchscreen controller
# --------------------------------------
#
# Required properties:
#  - compatible: "allwinner,sun4i-a10-ts", "allwinner,sun5i-a13-ts" or
#    "allwinner,sun6i-a31-ts"
#  - reg: mmio address range of the chip
#  - interrupts: interrupt to which the chip is connected
#  - #thermal-sensor-cells: shall be 0
#
# Optional properties:
#  - allwinner,ts-attached	 : boolean indicating that an actual touchscreen
# 				   is attached to the controller
#  - allwinner,tp-sensitive-adjust : integer (4 bits)
# 				   adjust sensitivity of pen down detection
# 				   between 0 (least sensitive) and 15
# 				   (defaults to 15)
#  - allwinner,filter-type	 : integer (2 bits)
# 				   select median and averaging filter
# 				   samples used for median / averaging filter
# 				   0: 4/2
# 				   1: 5/3
# 				   2: 8/4
# 				   3: 16/8
# 				   (defaults to 1)
#
# Example:
#
# 	rtp: rtp@01c25000 {
# 		compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-ts";
# 		reg = <0x01c25000 0x100>;
# 		interrupts = <29>;
# 		allwinner,ts-attached;
# 		#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;
# 		/* sensitive/noisy touch panel */
# 		allwinner,tp-sensitive-adjust = <0>;
# 		allwinner,filter-type = <3>;
# 	};
