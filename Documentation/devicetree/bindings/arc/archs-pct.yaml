# * ARC HS Performance Counters
#
# The ARC HS can be configured with a pipeline performance monitor for counting
# CPU and cache events like cache misses and hits. Like conventional PCT there
# are 100+ hardware conditions dynamically mapped to upto 32 counters.
# It also supports overflow interrupts.
#
# Required properties:
#
# - compatible : should contain
# 	"snps,archs-pct"
#
# Example:
#
# pmu {
#         compatible = "snps,archs-pct";
# };
