# * ARC Performance Counters
#
# The ARC700 can be configured with a pipeline performance monitor for counting
# CPU and cache events like cache misses and hits. Like conventional PCT there
# are 100+ hardware conditions dynamically mapped to upto 32 counters
#
# Note that:
#  * The ARC 700 PCT does not support interrupts; although HW events may be
#    counted, the HW events themselves cannot serve as a trigger for a sample.
#
# Required properties:
#
# - compatible : should contain
# 	"snps,arc700-pct"
#
# Example:
#
# pmu {
#         compatible = "snps,arc700-pct";
# };
