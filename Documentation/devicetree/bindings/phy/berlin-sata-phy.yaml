# Berlin SATA PHY
# ---------------
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: should be one of
#     "marvell,berlin2-sata-phy"
#     "marvell,berlin2q-sata-phy"
# - address-cells: should be 1
# - size-cells: should be 0
# - phy-cells: from the generic PHY bindings, must be 1
# - reg: address and length of the register
# - clocks: reference to the clock entry
#
# Sub-nodes:
# Each PHY should be represented as a sub-node.
#
# Sub-nodes required properties:
# - reg: the PHY number
#
# Example:
# 	sata_phy: phy@f7e900a0 {
# 		compatible = "marvell,berlin2q-sata-phy";
# 		reg = <0xf7e900a0 0x200>;
# 		clocks = <&chip CLKID_SATA>;
# 		#address-cells = <1>;
# 		#size-cells = <0>;
# 		#phy-cells = <1>;
#
# 		sata-phy@0 {
# 			reg = <0>;
# 		};
#
# 		sata-phy@1 {
# 			reg = <1>;
# 		};
# 	};
