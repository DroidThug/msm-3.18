# ROCKCHIP USB2 PHY
#
# Required properties:
#  - compatible: rockchip,rk3288-usb-phy
#  - rockchip,grf : phandle to the syscon managing the "general
#    register files"
#  - #address-cells: should be 1
#  - #size-cells: should be 0
#
# Sub-nodes:
# Each PHY should be represented as a sub-node.
#
# Sub-nodes
# required properties:
# - #phy-cells: should be 0
# - reg: PHY configure reg address offset in GRF
# 		"0x320" - for PHY attach to OTG controller
# 		"0x334" - for PHY attach to HOST0 controller
# 		"0x348" - for PHY attach to HOST1 controller
#
# Optional Properties:
# - clocks : phandle + clock specifier for the phy clocks
# - clock-names: string, clock name, must be "phyclk"
#
# Example:
#
# usbphy: phy {
# 	compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-usb-phy";
# 	rockchip,grf = <&grf>;
# 	#address-cells = <1>;
# 	#size-cells = <0>;
#
# 	usbphy0: usb-phy0 {
# 		#phy-cells = <0>;
# 		reg = <0x320>;
# 	};
# };
