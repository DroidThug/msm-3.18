# Freescale SAHARA Cryptographic Accelerator included in some i.MX chips.
# Currently only i.MX27 and i.MX53 are supported.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible : Should be "fsl,<soc>-sahara"
# - reg : Should contain SAHARA registers location and length
# - interrupts : Should contain SAHARA interrupt number
#
# Example:
#
# sah@10025000 {
# 	compatible = "fsl,imx27-sahara";
# 	reg = <	0x10025000 0x800>;
# 	interrupts = <75>;
# };
