# * Atmel HW cryptographic accelerators
#
# These are the HW cryptographic accelerators found on some Atmel products.
#
# * Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible : Should be "atmel,at91sam9g46-aes".
# - reg: Should contain AES registers location and length.
# - interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the AES.
# - dmas: List of two DMA specifiers as described in
#         atmel-dma.txt and dma.txt files.
# - dma-names: Contains one identifier string for each DMA specifier
#              in the dmas property.
#
# Example:
# aes@f8038000 {
# 	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g46-aes";
# 	reg = <0xf8038000 0x100>;
# 	interrupts = <43 4 0>;
# 	dmas = <&dma1 2 18>,
# 	       <&dma1 2 19>;
# 	dma-names = "tx", "rx";
#
# * Triple Data Encryption Standard (Triple DES)
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible : Should be "atmel,at91sam9g46-tdes".
# - reg: Should contain TDES registers location and length.
# - interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the TDES.
#
# Optional properties:
# - dmas: List of two DMA specifiers as described in
#         atmel-dma.txt and dma.txt files.
# - dma-names: Contains one identifier string for each DMA specifier
#              in the dmas property.
#
# Example:
# tdes@f803c000 {
# 	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g46-tdes";
# 	reg = <0xf803c000 0x100>;
# 	interrupts = <44 4 0>;
# 	dmas = <&dma1 2 20>,
# 	       <&dma1 2 21>;
# 	dma-names = "tx", "rx";
# };
#
# * Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA)
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible : Should be "atmel,at91sam9g46-sha".
# - reg: Should contain SHA registers location and length.
# - interrupts: Should contain the IRQ line for the SHA.
#
# Optional properties:
# - dmas: One DMA specifiers as described in
#         atmel-dma.txt and dma.txt files.
# - dma-names: Contains one identifier string for each DMA specifier
#              in the dmas property. Only one "tx" string needed.
#
# Example:
# sha@f8034000 {
# 	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9g46-sha";
# 	reg = <0xf8034000 0x100>;
# 	interrupts = <42 4 0>;
# 	dmas = <&dma1 2 17>;
# 	dma-names = "tx";
# };
