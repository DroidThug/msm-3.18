# * CSR SiRFprimaII Serial Peripheral Interface
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible : Should be "sirf,prima2-spi", "sirf,prima2-usp"
#                or "sirf,atlas7-usp"
# - reg : Offset and length of the register set for the device
# - interrupts : Should contain SPI interrupt
# - resets: phandle to the reset controller asserting this device in
#           reset
#   See ../reset/reset.txt for details.
# - dmas : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
#   See ../dma/dma.txt for details.
# - dma-names : Must include the following entries:
#   - rx
#   - tx
# - clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
#   See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.
#
# - #address-cells: Number of cells required to define a chip select
#                   address on the SPI bus. Should be set to 1.
# - #size-cells:    Should be zero.
#
# Optional properties:
# - spi-max-frequency: Specifies maximum SPI clock frequency,
#                      Units - Hz. Definition as per
#                      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/spi/spi-bus.txt
# - cs-gpios:     should specify GPIOs used for chipselects.
#
# Example:
#
# spi0: spi@b00d0000 {
# 	compatible = "sirf,prima2-spi";
# 	reg = <0xb00d0000 0x10000>;
# 	interrupts = <15>;
# 	dmas = <&dmac1 9>,
# 		<&dmac1 4>;
# 	dma-names = "rx", "tx";
# 	#address-cells = <1>;
# 	#size-cells = <0>;
# 	clocks = <&clks 19>;
# 	resets = <&rstc 26>;
# };
