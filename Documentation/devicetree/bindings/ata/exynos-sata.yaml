# * Samsung AHCI SATA Controller
#
# SATA nodes are defined to describe on-chip Serial ATA controllers.
# Each SATA controller should have its own node.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible		: compatible list, contains "samsung,exynos5-sata"
# - interrupts		: <interrupt mapping for SATA IRQ>
# - reg			: <registers mapping>
# - samsung,sata-freq	: <frequency in MHz>
# - phys			: Must contain exactly one entry as specified
# 			  in phy-bindings.txt
# - phy-names		: Must be "sata-phy"
#
# Optional properties:
# - clocks		: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
# - clock-names		: Shall be "sata" for the external SATA bus clock,
# 			  and "sclk_sata" for the internal controller clock.
#
# Example:
# 	sata@122f0000 {
# 		compatible = "snps,dwc-ahci";
# 		samsung,sata-freq = <66>;
# 		reg = <0x122f0000 0x1ff>;
# 		interrupts = <0 115 0>;
# 		clocks = <&clock 277>, <&clock 143>;
# 		clock-names = "sata", "sclk_sata";
# 		phys = <&sata_phy>;
# 		phy-names = "sata-phy";
# 	};
