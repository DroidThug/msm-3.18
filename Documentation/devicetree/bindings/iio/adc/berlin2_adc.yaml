# * Berlin Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)
#
# The Berlin ADC has 8 channels, with one connected to a temperature sensor.
# It is part of the system controller register set. The ADC node should be a
# sub-node of the system controller node.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: must be "marvell,berlin2-adc"
# - interrupts: the interrupts for the ADC and the temperature sensor
# - interrupt-names: should be "adc" and "tsen"
#
# Example:
#
# adc: adc {
# 	compatible = "marvell,berlin2-adc";
# 	interrupt-parent = <&sic>;
# 	interrupts = <12>, <14>;
# 	interrupt-names = "adc", "tsen";
# };
