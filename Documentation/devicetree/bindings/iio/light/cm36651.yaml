# * Capella CM36651 I2C Proximity and Color Light sensor
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: must be "capella,cm36651"
# - reg: the I2C address of the device
# - interrupts: interrupt-specifier for the sole interrupt
# 	      generated by the device
# - vled-supply: regulator for the IR LED. IR_LED is a part
# 	      of the cm36651 for proximity detection.
# 	      As covered in ../../regulator/regulator.txt
#
# Example:
#
# 	i2c_cm36651: i2c-gpio {
# 		/* ... */
#
# 		cm36651@18 {
# 			compatible = "capella,cm36651";
# 			reg = <0x18>;
# 			interrupt-parent = <&gpx0>;
# 			interrupts = <2 0>;
# 			vled-supply = <&ps_als_reg>;
# 		};
#
# 		/* ... */
# 	};
