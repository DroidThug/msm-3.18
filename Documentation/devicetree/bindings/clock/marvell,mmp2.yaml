# * Marvell MMP2 Clock Controller
#
# The MMP2 clock subsystem generates and supplies clock to various
# controllers within the MMP2 SoC.
#
# Required Properties:
#
# - compatible: should be one of the following.
#   - "marvell,mmp2-clock" - controller compatible with MMP2 SoC.
#
# - reg: physical base address of the clock subsystem and length of memory mapped
#   region. There are 3 places in SOC has clock control logic:
#   "mpmu", "apmu", "apbc". So three reg spaces need to be defined.
#
# - #clock-cells: should be 1.
# - #reset-cells: should be 1.
#
# Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes use this identifier
# to specify the clock which they consume.
#
# All these identifier could be found in <dt-bindings/clock/marvell-mmp2.h>.
