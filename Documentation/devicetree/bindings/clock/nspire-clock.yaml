# TI-NSPIRE Clocks
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: Valid compatible properties include:
# 	"lsi,nspire-cx-ahb-divider" for the AHB divider in the CX model
# 	"lsi,nspire-classic-ahb-divider" for the AHB divider in the older model
# 	"lsi,nspire-cx-clock" for the base clock in the CX model
# 	"lsi,nspire-classic-clock" for the base clock in the older model
#
# - reg: Physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
# 	region.
#
# Optional:
# - clocks: For the "nspire-*-ahb-divider" compatible clocks, this is the parent
# 	clock where it divides the rate from.
#
# Example:
#
# ahb_clk {
# 	#clock-cells = <0>;
# 	compatible = "lsi,nspire-cx-clock";
# 	reg = <0x900B0000 0x4>;
# 	clocks = <&base_clk>;
# };
