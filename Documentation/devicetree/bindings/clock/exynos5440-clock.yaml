# * Samsung Exynos5440 Clock Controller
#
# The Exynos5440 clock controller generates and supplies clock to various
# controllers within the Exynos5440 SoC.
#
# Required Properties:
#
# - compatible: should be "samsung,exynos5440-clock".
#
# - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
#   region.
#
# - #clock-cells: should be 1.
#
# Each clock is assigned an identifier and client nodes can use this identifier
# to specify the clock which they consume.
#
# All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
# dt-bindings/clock/exynos5440.h header and can be used in device
# tree sources.
#
# Example: An example of a clock controller node is listed below.
#
# 	clock: clock-controller@0x10010000 {
# 		compatible = "samsung,exynos5440-clock";
# 		reg = <0x160000 0x10000>;
# 		#clock-cells = <1>;
# 	};
