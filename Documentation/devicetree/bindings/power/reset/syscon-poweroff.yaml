# Generic SYSCON mapped register poweroff driver
#
# This is a generic poweroff driver using syscon to map the poweroff register.
# The poweroff is generally performed with a write to the poweroff register
# defined by the register map pointed by syscon reference plus the offset
# with the mask defined in the poweroff node.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: should contain "syscon-poweroff"
# - regmap: this is phandle to the register map node
# - offset: offset in the register map for the poweroff register (in bytes)
# - mask: the poweroff value written to the poweroff register (32 bit access)
#
# Default will be little endian mode, 32 bit access only.
#
# Examples:
#
# 	poweroff {
# 	   compatible = "syscon-poweroff";
# 	   regmap = <&regmapnode>;
# 	   offset = <0x0>;
# 	   mask = <0x7a>;
# 	};
