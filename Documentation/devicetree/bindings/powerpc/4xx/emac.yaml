#     4xx/Axon EMAC ethernet nodes
#
#     The EMAC ethernet controller in IBM and AMCC 4xx chips, and also
#     the Axon bridge.  To operate this needs to interact with a this
#     special McMAL DMA controller, and sometimes an RGMII or ZMII
#     interface.  In addition to the nodes and properties described
#     below, the node for the OPB bus on which the EMAC sits must have a
#     correct clock-frequency property.
#
#       i) The EMAC node itself
#
#     Required properties:
#     - device_type       : "network"
#
#     - compatible        : compatible list, contains 2 entries, first is
# 			  "ibm,emac-CHIP" where CHIP is the host ASIC (440gx,
# 			  405gp, Axon) and second is either "ibm,emac" or
# 			  "ibm,emac4".  For Axon, thus, we have: "ibm,emac-axon",
# 			  "ibm,emac4"
#     - interrupts        : <interrupt mapping for EMAC IRQ and WOL IRQ>
#     - interrupt-parent  : optional, if needed for interrupt mapping
#     - reg               : <registers mapping>
#     - local-mac-address : 6 bytes, MAC address
#     - mal-device        : phandle of the associated McMAL node
#     - mal-tx-channel    : 1 cell, index of the tx channel on McMAL associated
# 			  with this EMAC
#     - mal-rx-channel    : 1 cell, index of the rx channel on McMAL associated
# 			  with this EMAC
#     - cell-index        : 1 cell, hardware index of the EMAC cell on a given
# 			  ASIC (typically 0x0 and 0x1 for EMAC0 and EMAC1 on
# 			  each Axon chip)
#     - max-frame-size    : 1 cell, maximum frame size supported in bytes
#     - rx-fifo-size      : 1 cell, Rx fifo size in bytes for 10 and 100 Mb/sec
# 			  operations.
# 			  For Axon, 2048
#     - tx-fifo-size      : 1 cell, Tx fifo size in bytes for 10 and 100 Mb/sec
# 			  operations.
# 			  For Axon, 2048.
#     - fifo-entry-size   : 1 cell, size of a fifo entry (used to calculate
# 			  thresholds).
# 			  For Axon, 0x00000010
#     - mal-burst-size    : 1 cell, MAL burst size (used to calculate thresholds)
# 			  in bytes.
# 			  For Axon, 0x00000100 (I think ...)
#     - phy-mode          : string, mode of operations of the PHY interface.
# 			  Supported values are: "mii", "rmii", "smii", "rgmii",
# 			  "tbi", "gmii", rtbi", "sgmii".
# 			  For Axon on CAB, it is "rgmii"
#     - mdio-device       : 1 cell, required iff using shared MDIO registers
# 			  (440EP).  phandle of the EMAC to use to drive the
# 			  MDIO lines for the PHY used by this EMAC.
#     - zmii-device       : 1 cell, required iff connected to a ZMII.  phandle of
# 			  the ZMII device node
#     - zmii-channel      : 1 cell, required iff connected to a ZMII.  Which ZMII
# 			  channel or 0xffffffff if ZMII is only used for MDIO.
#     - rgmii-device      : 1 cell, required iff connected to an RGMII. phandle
# 			  of the RGMII device node.
# 			  For Axon: phandle of plb5/plb4/opb/rgmii
#     - rgmii-channel     : 1 cell, required iff connected to an RGMII.  Which
# 			  RGMII channel is used by this EMAC.
# 			  Fox Axon: present, whatever value is appropriate for each
# 			  EMAC, that is the content of the current (bogus) "phy-port"
# 			  property.
#
#     Optional properties:
#     - phy-address       : 1 cell, optional, MDIO address of the PHY. If absent,
# 			  a search is performed.
#     - phy-map           : 1 cell, optional, bitmap of addresses to probe the PHY
# 			  for, used if phy-address is absent. bit 0x00000001 is
# 			  MDIO address 0.
# 			  For Axon it can be absent, though my current driver
# 			  doesn't handle phy-address yet so for now, keep
# 			  0x00ffffff in it.
#     - rx-fifo-size-gige : 1 cell, Rx fifo size in bytes for 1000 Mb/sec
# 			  operations (if absent the value is the same as
# 			  rx-fifo-size).  For Axon, either absent or 2048.
#     - tx-fifo-size-gige : 1 cell, Tx fifo size in bytes for 1000 Mb/sec
# 			  operations (if absent the value is the same as
# 			  tx-fifo-size). For Axon, either absent or 2048.
#     - tah-device        : 1 cell, optional. If connected to a TAH engine for
# 			  offload, phandle of the TAH device node.
#     - tah-channel       : 1 cell, optional. If appropriate, channel used on the
# 			  TAH engine.
#
#     Example:
#
# 	EMAC0: ethernet@40000800 {
# 		device_type = "network";
# 		compatible = "ibm,emac-440gp", "ibm,emac";
# 		interrupt-parent = <&UIC1>;
# 		interrupts = <1c 4 1d 4>;
# 		reg = <40000800 70>;
# 		local-mac-address = [00 04 AC E3 1B 1E];
# 		mal-device = <&MAL0>;
# 		mal-tx-channel = <0 1>;
# 		mal-rx-channel = <0>;
# 		cell-index = <0>;
# 		max-frame-size = <5dc>;
# 		rx-fifo-size = <1000>;
# 		tx-fifo-size = <800>;
# 		phy-mode = "rmii";
# 		phy-map = <00000001>;
# 		zmii-device = <&ZMII0>;
# 		zmii-channel = <0>;
# 	};
#
#       ii) McMAL node
#
#     Required properties:
#     - device_type        : "dma-controller"
#     - compatible         : compatible list, containing 2 entries, first is
# 			   "ibm,mcmal-CHIP" where CHIP is the host ASIC (like
# 			   emac) and the second is either "ibm,mcmal" or
# 			   "ibm,mcmal2".
# 			   For Axon, "ibm,mcmal-axon","ibm,mcmal2"
#     - interrupts         : <interrupt mapping for the MAL interrupts sources:
#                            5 sources: tx_eob, rx_eob, serr, txde, rxde>.
#                            For Axon: This is _different_ from the current
# 			   firmware.  We use the "delayed" interrupts for txeob
# 			   and rxeob. Thus we end up with mapping those 5 MPIC
# 			   interrupts, all level positive sensitive: 10, 11, 32,
# 			   33, 34 (in decimal)
#     - dcr-reg            : < DCR registers range >
#     - dcr-parent         : if needed for dcr-reg
#     - num-tx-chans       : 1 cell, number of Tx channels
#     - num-rx-chans       : 1 cell, number of Rx channels
#
#       iii) ZMII node
#
#     Required properties:
#     - compatible         : compatible list, containing 2 entries, first is
# 			   "ibm,zmii-CHIP" where CHIP is the host ASIC (like
# 			   EMAC) and the second is "ibm,zmii".
# 			   For Axon, there is no ZMII node.
#     - reg                : <registers mapping>
#
#       iv) RGMII node
#
#     Required properties:
#     - compatible         : compatible list, containing 2 entries, first is
# 			   "ibm,rgmii-CHIP" where CHIP is the host ASIC (like
# 			   EMAC) and the second is "ibm,rgmii".
#                            For Axon, "ibm,rgmii-axon","ibm,rgmii"
#     - reg                : <registers mapping>
#     - revision           : as provided by the RGMII new version register if
# 			   available.
# 			   For Axon: 0x0000012a
