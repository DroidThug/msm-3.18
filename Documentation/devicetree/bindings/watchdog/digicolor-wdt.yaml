# Conexant Digicolor SoCs Watchdog timer
#
# The watchdog functionality in Conexant Digicolor SoCs relies on the so called
# "Agent Communication" block. This block includes the eight programmable system
# timer counters. The first timer (called "Timer A") is the only one that can be
# used as watchdog.
#
# Required properties:
#
# - compatible : Should be "cnxt,cx92755-wdt"
# - reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers
# - clocks : phandle; specifies the clock that drives the timer
#
# Optional properties:
#
# - timeout-sec : Contains the watchdog timeout in seconds
#
# Example:
#
# 	watchdog@f0000fc0 {
# 		compatible = "cnxt,cx92755-wdt";
# 		reg = <0xf0000fc0 0x8>;
# 		clocks = <&main_clk>;
# 		timeout-sec = <15>;
# 	};
