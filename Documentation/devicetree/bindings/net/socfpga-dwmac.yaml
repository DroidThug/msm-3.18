# Altera SOCFPGA SoC DWMAC controller
#
# This is a variant of the dwmac/stmmac driver an inherits all descriptions
# present in Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/stmmac.txt.
#
# The device node has additional properties:
#
# Required properties:
#  - compatible	: Should contain "altr,socfpga-stmmac" along with
# 		  "snps,dwmac" and any applicable more detailed
# 		  designware version numbers documented in stmmac.txt
#  - altr,sysmgr-syscon : Should be the phandle to the system manager node that
#    encompasses the glue register, the register offset, and the register shift.
#
# Optional properties:
# altr,emac-splitter: Should be the phandle to the emac splitter soft IP node if
# 		DWMAC controller is connected emac splitter.
#
# Example:
#
# gmac0: ethernet@ff700000 {
# 	compatible = "altr,socfpga-stmmac", "snps,dwmac-3.70a", "snps,dwmac";
# 	altr,sysmgr-syscon = <&sysmgr 0x60 0>;
# 	status = "disabled";
# 	reg = <0xff700000 0x2000>;
# 	interrupts = <0 115 4>;
# 	interrupt-names = "macirq";
# 	mac-address = [00 00 00 00 00 00];/* Filled in by U-Boot */
# 	clocks = <&emac_0_clk>;
# 	clock-names = "stmmaceth";
# };
