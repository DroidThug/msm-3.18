# * Microchip MCP251X stand-alone CAN controller device tree bindings
#
# Required properties:
#  - compatible: Should be one of the following:
#    - "microchip,mcp2510" for MCP2510.
#    - "microchip,mcp2515" for MCP2515.
#  - reg: SPI chip select.
#  - clocks: The clock feeding the CAN controller.
#  - interrupt-parent: The parent interrupt controller.
#  - interrupts: Should contain IRQ line for the CAN controller.
#
# Optional properties:
#  - vdd-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN controller.
#  - xceiver-supply: Regulator that powers the CAN transceiver.
#
# Example:
# 	can0: can@1 {
# 		compatible = "microchip,mcp2515";
# 		reg = <1>;
# 		clocks = <&clk24m>;
# 		interrupt-parent = <&gpio4>;
# 		interrupts = <13 0x2>;
# 		vdd-supply = <&reg5v0>;
# 		xceiver-supply = <&reg5v0>;
# 	};
