# * Allwinner GMAC ethernet controller
#
# This device is a platform glue layer for stmmac.
# Please see stmmac.txt for the other unchanged properties.
#
# Required properties:
#  - compatible:  Should be "allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac"
#  - clocks: Should contain the GMAC main clock, and tx clock
#    The tx clock type should be "allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac-clk"
#  - clock-names: Should contain the clock names "stmmaceth",
#    and "allwinner_gmac_tx"
#
# Optional properties:
# - phy-supply: phandle to a regulator if the PHY needs one
#
# Examples:
#
# 	gmac: ethernet@01c50000 {
# 		compatible = "allwinner,sun7i-a20-gmac";
# 		reg = <0x01c50000 0x10000>,
# 		      <0x01c20164 0x4>;
# 		interrupts = <0 85 1>;
# 		interrupt-names = "macirq";
# 		clocks = <&ahb_gates 49>, <&gmac_tx>;
# 		clock-names = "stmmaceth", "allwinner_gmac_tx";
# 		phy-mode = "mii";
# 	};
