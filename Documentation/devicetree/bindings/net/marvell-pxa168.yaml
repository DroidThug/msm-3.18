# * Marvell PXA168 Ethernet Controller
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: should be "marvell,pxa168-eth".
# - reg: address and length of the register set for the device.
# - interrupts: interrupt for the device.
# - clocks: pointer to the clock for the device.
#
# Optional properties:
# - port-id: Ethernet port number. Should be '0','1' or '2'.
# - #address-cells: must be 1 when using sub-nodes.
# - #size-cells: must be 0 when using sub-nodes.
# - phy-handle: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
# - local-mac-address: see ethernet.txt file in the same directory.
#
# Sub-nodes:
# Each PHY can be represented as a sub-node. This is not mandatory.
#
# Sub-nodes required properties:
# - reg: the MDIO address of the PHY.
#
# Example:
#
# 	eth0: ethernet@f7b90000 {
# 		compatible = "marvell,pxa168-eth";
# 		reg = <0xf7b90000 0x10000>;
# 		clocks = <&chip CLKID_GETH0>;
# 		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 24 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
# 		#address-cells = <1>;
# 		#size-cells = <0>;
# 		phy-handle = <&ethphy0>;
#
# 		ethphy0: ethernet-phy@0 {
# 			reg = <0>;
# 		};
# 	};
