# * HID over I2C Device-Tree bindings
#
# HID over I2C provides support for various Human Interface Devices over the
# I2C bus. These devices can be for example touchpads, keyboards, touch screens
# or sensors.
#
# The specification has been written by Microsoft and is currently available here:
# http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh852380.aspx
#
# If this binding is used, the kernel module i2c-hid will handle the communication
# with the device and the generic hid core layer will handle the protocol.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: must be "hid-over-i2c"
# - reg: i2c slave address
# - hid-descr-addr: HID descriptor address
# - interrupt-parent: the phandle for the interrupt controller
# - interrupts: interrupt line
#
# Example:
#
# 	i2c-hid-dev@2c {
# 		compatible = "hid-over-i2c";
# 		reg = <0x2c>;
# 		hid-descr-addr = <0x0020>;
# 		interrupt-parent = <&gpx3>;
# 		interrupts = <3 2>;
# 	};
