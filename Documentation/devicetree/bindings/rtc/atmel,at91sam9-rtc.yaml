# Atmel AT91SAM9260 Real Time Timer
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: should be: "atmel,at91sam9260-rtt"
# - reg: should encode the memory region of the RTT controller
# - interrupts: rtt alarm/event interrupt
# - clocks: should contain the 32 KHz slow clk that will drive the RTT block.
# - atmel,rtt-rtc-time-reg: should encode the GPBR register used to store
# 	the time base when the RTT is used as an RTC.
# 	The first cell should point to the GPBR node and the second one
# 	encode the offset within the GPBR block (or in other words, the
# 	GPBR register used to store the time base).
#
#
# Example:
#
# rtt@fffffd20 {
# 	compatible = "atmel,at91sam9260-rtt";
# 	reg = <0xfffffd20 0x10>;
# 	interrupts = <1 4 7>;
# 	clocks = <&clk32k>;
# 	atmel,rtt-rtc-time-reg = <&gpbr 0x0>;
# };
