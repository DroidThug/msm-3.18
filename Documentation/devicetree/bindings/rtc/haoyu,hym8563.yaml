# Haoyu Microelectronics HYM8563 Real Time Clock
#
# The HYM8563 provides basic rtc and alarm functionality
# as well as a clock output of up to 32kHz.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: should be: "haoyu,hym8563"
# - reg: i2c address
# - #clock-cells: the value should be 0
#
# Optional properties:
# - clock-output-names: From common clock binding
# - interrupts: rtc alarm/event interrupt
#
# Example:
#
# hym8563: hym8563@51 {
# 	compatible = "haoyu,hym8563";
# 	reg = <0x51>;
#
# 	interrupts = <13 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_FALLING>;
#
# 	#clock-cells = <0>;
# };
#
# device {
# ...
# 	clocks = <&hym8563>;
# ...
# };
