# * Marvell Real Time Clock controller
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: should be "mrvl,sa1100-rtc"
# - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
#   region.
# - interrupts: Should be two. The first interrupt number is the rtc alarm
#   interrupt and the second interrupt number is the rtc hz interrupt.
# - interrupt-names: Assign name of irq resource.
#
# Example:
# 	rtc: rtc@d4010000 {
# 		compatible = "mrvl,mmp-rtc";
# 		reg = <0xd4010000 0x1000>;
# 		interrupts = <5>, <6>;
# 		interrupt-name = "rtc 1Hz", "rtc alarm";
# 	};
