# * Xen hypervisor device tree bindings
#
# Xen ARM virtual platforms shall have a top-level "hypervisor" node with
# the following properties:
#
# - compatible:
# 	compatible = "xen,xen-<version>", "xen,xen";
#   where <version> is the version of the Xen ABI of the platform.
#
# - reg: specifies the base physical address and size of a region in
#   memory where the grant table should be mapped to, using an
#   HYPERVISOR_memory_op hypercall. The memory region is large enough to map
#   the whole grant table (it is larger or equal to gnttab_max_grant_frames()).
#
# - interrupts: the interrupt used by Xen to inject event notifications.
#   A GIC node is also required.
#
#
# Example (assuming #address-cells = <2> and #size-cells = <2>):
#
# hypervisor {
# 	compatible = "xen,xen-4.3", "xen,xen";
# 	reg = <0 0xb0000000 0 0x20000>;
# 	interrupts = <1 15 0xf08>;
# };
