# TI Keystone Platforms Device Tree Bindings
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# Boards with Keystone2 based devices (TCI66xxK2H) SOC shall have the
# following properties.
#
# Required properties:
#  - compatible: All TI specific devices present in Keystone SOC should be in
#    the form "ti,keystone-*". Generic devices like gic, arch_timers, ns16550
#    type UART should use the specified compatible for those devices.
#
# Boards:
# -  Keystone 2 Hawking/Kepler EVM
#    compatible = "ti,k2hk-evm","ti,keystone"
#
# -  Keystone 2 Lamarr EVM
#    compatible = "ti,k2l-evm","ti,keystone"
#
# -  Keystone 2 Edison EVM
#    compatible = "ti,k2e-evm","ti,keystone"
