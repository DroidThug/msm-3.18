# * ARMv7M System Timer
#
# ARMv7-M includes a system timer, known as SysTick. Current driver only
# implements the clocksource feature.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible	  : Should be "arm,armv7m-systick"
# - reg		  : The address range of the timer
#
# Required clocking property, have to be one of:
# - clocks	  : The input clock of the timer
# - clock-frequency : The rate in HZ in input of the ARM SysTick
#
# Examples:
#
# systick: timer@e000e010 {
# 	compatible = "arm,armv7m-systick";
# 	reg = <0xe000e010 0x10>;
# 	clocks = <&clk_systick>;
# };
#
# systick: timer@e000e010 {
# 	compatible = "arm,armv7m-systick";
# 	reg = <0xe000e010 0x10>;
# 	clock-frequency = <90000000>;
# };
