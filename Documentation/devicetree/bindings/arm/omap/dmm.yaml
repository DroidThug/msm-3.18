# OMAP Dynamic Memory Manager (DMM) bindings
#
# The dynamic memory manager (DMM) is a module located immediately in front of the
# SDRAM controllers (called EMIFs on OMAP). DMM manages various aspects of memory
# accesses such as priority generation amongst initiators, configuration of SDRAM
# interleaving, optimizing transfer of 2D block objects, and provide MMU-like page
# translation for initiators which need contiguous dma bus addresses.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible:	Should contain "ti,omap4-dmm" for OMAP4 family
# 		Should contain "ti,omap5-dmm" for OMAP5 and DRA7x family
# - reg:		Contains DMM register address range (base address and length)
# - interrupts:	Should contain an interrupt-specifier for DMM_IRQ.
# - ti,hwmods:	Name of the hwmod associated to DMM, which is typically "dmm"
#
# Example:
#
# dmm@4e000000 {
# 	compatible = "ti,omap4-dmm";
# 	reg = <0x4e000000 0x800>;
# 	ti,hwmods = "dmm";
# };
