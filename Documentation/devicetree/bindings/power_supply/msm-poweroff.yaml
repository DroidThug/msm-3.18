# MSM Restart Driver
#
# A power supply hold (ps-hold) bit is set to power the msm chipsets.
# Clearing that bit allows us to restart/poweroff. The difference
# between poweroff and restart is determined by unique power manager IC
# settings.
#
# Required Properties:
# -compatible: "qcom,pshold"
# -reg: Specifies the physical address of the ps-hold register
#
# Example:
#
# 	restart@fc4ab000 {
# 		compatible = "qcom,pshold";
# 		reg = <0xfc4ab000 0x4>;
# 	};
