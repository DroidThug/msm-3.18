# * Rockchip specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
#   Storage Host Controller
#
# The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
# a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
# differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
# by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Rockchip specific
# extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.
#
# Required Properties:
#
# * compatible: should be
# 	- "rockchip,rk2928-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK2928 and following,
# 							before RK3288
# 	- "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc": for Rockchip RK3288
#
# Example:
#
# 	rkdwmmc0@12200000 {
# 		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc";
# 		reg = <0x12200000 0x1000>;
# 		interrupts = <0 75 0>;
# 		#address-cells = <1>;
# 		#size-cells = <0>;
# 	};
