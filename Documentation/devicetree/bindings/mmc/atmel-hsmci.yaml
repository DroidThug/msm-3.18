# * Atmel High Speed MultiMedia Card Interface
#
# This controller on atmel products provides an interface for MMC, SD and SDIO
# types of memory cards.
#
# This file documents differences between the core properties described
# by mmc.txt and the properties used by the atmel-mci driver.
#
# 1) MCI node
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: should be "atmel,hsmci"
# - #address-cells: should be one. The cell is the slot id.
# - #size-cells: should be zero.
# - at least one slot node
# - clock-names: tuple listing input clock names.
# 	Required elements: "mci_clk"
# - clocks: phandles to input clocks.
#
# The node contains child nodes for each slot that the platform uses
#
# Example MCI node:
#
# mmc0: mmc@f0008000 {
# 	compatible = "atmel,hsmci";
# 	reg = <0xf0008000 0x600>;
# 	interrupts = <12 4>;
# 	#address-cells = <1>;
# 	#size-cells = <0>;
# 	clock-names = "mci_clk";
# 	clocks = <&mci0_clk>;
#
# 	[ child node definitions...]
# };
#
# 2) slot nodes
#
# Required properties:
# - reg: should contain the slot id.
# - bus-width: number of data lines connected to the controller
#
# Optional properties:
# - cd-gpios: specify GPIOs for card detection
# - cd-inverted: invert the value of external card detect gpio line
# - wp-gpios: specify GPIOs for write protection
#
# Example slot node:
#
# slot@0 {
# 	reg = <0>;
# 	bus-width = <4>;
# 	cd-gpios = <&pioD 15 0>
# 	cd-inverted;
# };
#
# Example full MCI node:
# mmc0: mmc@f0008000 {
# 	compatible = "atmel,hsmci";
# 	reg = <0xf0008000 0x600>;
# 	interrupts = <12 4>;
# 	#address-cells = <1>;
# 	#size-cells = <0>;
# 	slot@0 {
# 		reg = <0>;
# 		bus-width = <4>;
# 		cd-gpios = <&pioD 15 0>
# 		cd-inverted;
# 	};
# 	slot@1 {
# 		reg = <1>;
# 		bus-width = <4>;
# 	};
# };
