# * Altera SOCFPGA specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
#   Storage Host Controller
#
# The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
# a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
# differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
# by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Altera SOCFPGA specific
# extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.
#
# Required Properties:
#
# * compatible: should be
# 	- "altr,socfpga-dw-mshc": for Altera's SOCFPGA platform
#
# Example:
#
# 	mmc: dwmmc0@ff704000 {
# 		compatible = "altr,socfpga-dw-mshc";
# 		reg = <0xff704000 0x1000>;
# 		interrupts = <0 129 4>;
# 		#address-cells = <1>;
# 		#size-cells = <0>;
# 	};
