# * TI MMC host controller for OMAP1 and 2420
#
# The MMC Host Controller on TI OMAP1 and 2420 family provides
# an interface for MMC, SD, and SDIO types of memory cards.
#
# This file documents differences between the core properties described
# by mmc.txt and the properties used by the omap mmc driver.
#
# Note that this driver will not work with omap2430 or later omaps,
# please see the omap hsmmc driver for the current omaps.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: Must be "ti,omap2420-mmc", for OMAP2420 controllers
# - ti,hwmods: For 2420, must be "msdi<n>", where n is controller
#   instance starting 1
#
# Examples:
#
# 	msdi1: mmc@4809c000 {
# 		compatible = "ti,omap2420-mmc";
# 		ti,hwmods = "msdi1";
# 		reg = <0x4809c000 0x80>;
# 		interrupts = <83>;
# 		dmas = <&sdma 61 &sdma 62>;
# 		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
# 	};
