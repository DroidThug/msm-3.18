# TI Keystone Soc USB Controller
#
# DWC3 GLUE
#
# Required properties:
#  - compatible: should be "ti,keystone-dwc3".
#  - #address-cells, #size-cells : should be '1' if the device has sub-nodes
#    with 'reg' property.
#  - reg : Address and length of the register set for the USB subsystem on
#    the SOC.
#  - interrupts : The irq number of this device that is used to interrupt the
#    MPU.
#  - ranges: allows valid 1:1 translation between child's address space and
#    parent's address space.
#  - clocks: Clock IDs array as required by the controller.
#  - clock-names: names of clocks correseponding to IDs in the clock property.
#
# Sub-nodes:
# The dwc3 core should be added as subnode to Keystone DWC3 glue.
# - dwc3 :
#    The binding details of dwc3 can be found in:
#    Documentation/devicetree/bindings/usb/dwc3.txt
#
# Example:
# 	usb: usb@2680000 {
# 		compatible = "ti,keystone-dwc3";
# 		#address-cells = <1>;
# 		#size-cells = <1>;
# 		reg = <0x2680000 0x10000>;
# 		clocks = <&clkusb>;
# 		clock-names = "usb";
# 		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 393 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
# 		ranges;
# 		status = "disabled";
#
# 		dwc3@2690000 {
# 			compatible = "synopsys,dwc3";
# 			reg = <0x2690000 0x70000>;
# 			interrupts = <GIC_SPI 393 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
# 			usb-phy = <&usb_phy>, <&usb_phy>;
# 		};
# 	};
