# Samsung High Speed USB OTG controller
# -----------------------------
#
# The Samsung HSOTG IP can be found on Samsung SoCs, from S3C6400 onwards.
# It gives functionality of OTG-compliant USB 2.0 host and device with
# support for USB 2.0 high-speed (480Mbps) and full-speed (12 Mbps)
# operation.
#
# Currently only device mode is supported.
#
# Binding details
# -----
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible: "samsung,s3c6400-hsotg" should be used for all currently
#     supported SoC,
# - interrupt-parent: phandle for the interrupt controller to which the
#     interrupt signal of the HSOTG block is routed,
# - interrupts: specifier of interrupt signal of interrupt controller,
#     according to bindings of interrupt controller,
# - clocks: contains an array of clock specifiers:
#     - first entry: OTG clock
# - clock-names: contains array of clock names:
#     - first entry: must be "otg"
# - vusb_d-supply: phandle to voltage regulator of digital section,
# - vusb_a-supply: phandle to voltage regulator of analog section.
#
# Example
# -----
#
# 	hsotg@12480000 {
# 		compatible = "samsung,s3c6400-hsotg";
# 		reg = <0x12480000 0x20000>;
# 		interrupts = <0 71 0>;
# 		clocks = <&clock 305>;
# 		clock-names = "otg";
# 		vusb_d-supply = <&vusb_reg>;
# 		vusb_a-supply = <&vusbdac_reg>;
# 	};
