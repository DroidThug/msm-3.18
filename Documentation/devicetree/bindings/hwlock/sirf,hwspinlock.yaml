# SIRF Hardware spinlock device Binding
# -----------------------------------------------
#
# Required properties :
# - compatible : shall contain only one of the following:
# 	"sirf,hwspinlock"
#
# - reg : the register address of hwspinlock
#
# - #hwlock-cells : hwlock users only use the hwlock id to represent a specific
# 	hwlock, so the number of cells should be <1> here.
#
# Please look at the generic hwlock binding for usage information for consumers,
# "Documentation/devicetree/bindings/hwlock/hwlock.txt"
#
# Example of hwlock provider:
# 	hwlock {
# 		compatible = "sirf,hwspinlock";
# 		reg = <0x13240000 0x00010000>;
# 		#hwlock-cells = <1>;
# 	};
#
# Example of hwlock users:
# 	node {
# 		...
# 		hwlocks = <&hwlock 2>;
# 		...
# 	};
