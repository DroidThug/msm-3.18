# * Marvell SoC pinctrl core driver for mpp
#
# The pinctrl driver enables Marvell SoCs to configure the multi-purpose pins
# (mpp) to a specific function. For each SoC family there is a SoC specific
# driver using this core driver.
#
# Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
# common pinctrl bindings used by client devices, including the meaning of the
# phrase "pin configuration node".
#
# A Marvell SoC pin configuration node is a node of a group of pins which can
# be used for a specific device or function. Each node requires one or more
# mpp pins or group of pins and a mpp function common to all pins.
#
# Required properties for pinctrl driver:
# - compatible: "marvell,<soc>-pinctrl"
#   Please refer to each marvell,<soc>-pinctrl.txt binding doc for supported SoCs.
#
# Required properties for pin configuration node:
# - marvell,pins: string array of mpp pins or group of pins to be muxed.
# - marvell,function: string representing a function to mux to for all
#     marvell,pins given in this pin configuration node. The function has to be
#     common for all marvell,pins. Please refer to marvell,<soc>-pinctrl.txt for
#     valid pin/pin group names and available function names for each SoC.
#
# Examples:
#
# uart1: serial@12100 {
# 	compatible = "ns16550a";
# 	reg = <0x12100 0x100>;
# 	reg-shift = <2>;
# 	interrupts = <7>;
#
# 	pinctrl-0 = <&pmx_uart1_sw>;
# 	pinctrl-names = "default";
# };
#
# pinctrl: pinctrl@d0200 {
# 	compatible = "marvell,dove-pinctrl";
# 	reg = <0xd0200 0x14>, <0xd0440 0x04>, <0xd802c 0x08>;
#
# 	pmx_uart1_sw: pmx-uart1-sw {
# 		marvell,pins = "mpp_uart1";
# 		marvell,function = "uart1";
# 	};
# };
