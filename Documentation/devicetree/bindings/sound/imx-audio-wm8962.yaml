# Freescale i.MX audio complex with WM8962 codec
#
# Required properties:
#
#   - compatible		: "fsl,imx-audio-wm8962"
#
#   - model		: The user-visible name of this sound complex
#
#   - ssi-controller	: The phandle of the i.MX SSI controller
#
#   - audio-codec		: The phandle of the WM8962 audio codec
#
#   - audio-routing	: A list of the connections between audio components.
# 			  Each entry is a pair of strings, the first being the
# 			  connection's sink, the second being the connection's
# 			  source. Valid names could be power supplies, WM8962
# 			  pins, and the jacks on the board:
#
# 			  Power supplies:
# 			   * Mic Bias
#
# 			  Board connectors:
# 			   * Mic Jack
# 			   * Headphone Jack
# 			   * Ext Spk
#
#   - mux-int-port	: The internal port of the i.MX audio muxer (AUDMUX)
#
#   - mux-ext-port	: The external port of the i.MX audio muxer
#
# Note: The AUDMUX port numbering should start at 1, which is consistent with
# hardware manual.
#
# Example:
#
# sound {
# 	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-sabresd-wm8962",
# 		     "fsl,imx-audio-wm8962";
# 	model = "wm8962-audio";
# 	ssi-controller = <&ssi2>;
# 	audio-codec = <&codec>;
# 		audio-routing =
# 		"Headphone Jack", "HPOUTL",
# 		"Headphone Jack", "HPOUTR",
# 		"Ext Spk", "SPKOUTL",
# 		"Ext Spk", "SPKOUTR",
# 		"MICBIAS", "AMIC",
# 		"IN3R", "MICBIAS",
# 		"DMIC", "MICBIAS",
# 		"DMICDAT", "DMIC";
# 	mux-int-port = <2>;
# 	mux-ext-port = <3>;
# };
