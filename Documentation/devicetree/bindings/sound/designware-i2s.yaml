# DesignWare I2S controller
#
# Required properties:
#  - compatible : Must be "snps,designware-i2s"
#  - reg : Must contain the I2S core's registers location and length
#  - clocks : Pairs of phandle and specifier referencing the controller's
#    clocks. The controller expects one clock: the clock used as the sampling
#    rate reference clock sample.
#  - clock-names : "i2sclk" for the sample rate reference clock.
#  - dmas: Pairs of phandle and specifier for the DMA channels that are used by
#    the core. The core expects one or two dma channels: one for transmit and
#    one for receive.
#  - dma-names : "tx" for the transmit channel, "rx" for the receive channel.
#
# For more details on the 'dma', 'dma-names', 'clock' and 'clock-names'
# properties please check:

# 	* clock/clock-bindings.txt
# 	* dma/dma.txt
#
# Example:
#
# 	soc_i2s: i2s@7ff90000 {
# 		compatible = "snps,designware-i2s";
# 		reg = <0x0 0x7ff90000 0x0 0x1000>;
# 		clocks = <&scpi_i2sclk 0>;
# 		clock-names = "i2sclk";
# 		#sound-dai-cells = <0>;
# 		dmas = <&dma0 5>;
# 		dma-names = "tx";
# 	};
