# BCM2835 System Timer
#
# The System Timer peripheral provides four 32-bit timer channels and a
# single 64-bit free running counter. Each channel has an output compare
# register, which is compared against the 32 least significant bits of the
# free running counter values, and generates an interrupt.
#
# Required properties:
#
# - compatible : should be "brcm,bcm2835-system-timer"
# - reg : Specifies base physical address and size of the registers.
# - interrupts : A list of 4 interrupt sinks; one per timer channel.
# - clock-frequency : The frequency of the clock that drives the counter, in Hz.
#
# Example:
#
# timer {
# 	compatible = "brcm,bcm2835-system-timer";
# 	reg = <0x7e003000 0x1000>;
# 	interrupts = <1 0>, <1 1>, <1 2>, <1 3>;
# 	clock-frequency = <1000000>;
# };
