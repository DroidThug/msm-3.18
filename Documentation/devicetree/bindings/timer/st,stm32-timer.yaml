# . STMicroelectronics STM32 timer
#
# The STM32 MCUs family has several general-purpose 16 and 32 bits timers.
#
# Required properties:
# - compatible : Should be "st,stm32-timer"
# - reg : Address and length of the register set
# - clocks : Reference on the timer input clock
# - interrupts : Reference to the timer interrupt
#
# Optional properties:
# - resets: Reference to a reset controller asserting the timer
#
# Example:
#
# timer5: timer@40000c00 {
# 	compatible = "st,stm32-timer";
# 	reg = <0x40000c00 0x400>;
# 	interrupts = <50>;
# 	resets = <&rrc 259>;
# 	clocks = <&clk_pmtr1>;
# };
