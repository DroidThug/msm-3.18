# TI-NSPIRE timer
#
# Required properties:
#
# - compatible : should be "lsi,zevio-timer".
# - reg : The physical base address and size of the timer (always first).
# - clocks: phandle to the source clock.
#
# Optional properties:
#
# - interrupts : The interrupt number of the first timer.
# - reg : The interrupt acknowledgement registers
# 	(always after timer base address)
#
# If any of the optional properties are not given, the timer is added as a
# clock-source only.
#
# Example:
#
# timer {
# 	compatible = "lsi,zevio-timer";
# 	reg = <0x900D0000 0x1000>, <0x900A0020 0x8>;
# 	interrupts = <19>;
# 	clocks = <&timer_clk>;
# };
#
# Example (no clock-events):
#
# timer {
# 	compatible = "lsi,zevio-timer";
# 	reg = <0x900D0000 0x1000>;
# 	clocks = <&timer_clk>;
# };
